## Recommendations and Referrals

### Selected quotes from PhD, Masters, & Undergraduate students I have supervised:

> "I first met Frazer when I was deciding to pursue a PhD; he provided me with insight both into the life of a PhD student and life in our group. Throughout my time with him, I have witnessed his **passion for imparting knowledge**, both in a private capacity and to groups of others. He has **mentored me on numerous occasions**, guiding me when our supervisor was busy. I have also seen him teach undergraduates, where he **meticulously explains concepts repeatedly until they are satisfied**. Frazer also demonstrates a strong desire to **maintain a cohesive group, organizing regular informal meetings for students and PDRAs to get together, share ideas, and solve problems**. I believe he deserves this award because of all these qualities and actions, along with personally mentoring me and many others during his PhD and into his RA position."

> "... because of his **exceptional mentorship during my MChem project**. Frazer **embodies the qualities of an outstanding supervisor, demonstrating remarkable patience, availability, and a genuine commitment to his students' success**.
Throughout my project, Frazer **consistently made himself available** for guidance and support. He **not only welcomed my questions but also provided insightful explanations that went beyond the surface level**. His patience in guiding me through complex concepts and methodologies was invaluable, as it helped me gain a deeper understanding of my research. And through gaining a deeper understanding it has really allowed me to gain a true interest and enjoyment for my research.
What truly sets Frazer apart is his dedication to **going above and beyond for his students**. He **curated personalised resources tailored to my project**, ensuring that I had all the tools necessary to succeed. He has **spent countless hours writing code and scripts not just for me but for all the members of our group**. His feedback and discussions were instrumental in **boosting my confidence and encouraging me to become more independent in my research endeavours**.
Furthermore, Frazer's inclusive approach to mentorship made me **feel like a valued member of the research group**. He actively incorporated me into group discussions and activities, fostering a sense of belonging and camaraderie. This inclusivity not only enhanced my University experience but also contributed to my personal and academic growth"
