## Nomination Quote
<div class="highlight-box">
"Frazer was the first colleague I met during my PhD career and made a strong impression with his enthusiasm and helpfulness. He always went out of his way to explain things clearly, showing patience even when I asked the same question multiple times... Throughout my project, he provided support at every step, often writing code and creating programs to assist not only me but the entire group... Frazer also organizes regular group discussions, fostering an open environment where we can share our experiences and build stronger relationships... He is a reliable, trustworthy, and professionally competent friend."
