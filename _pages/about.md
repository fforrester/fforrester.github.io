## About Me
Hi, I'm **Frazer Forrester**, a Research Assistant in **Inorganic Materials** in the School of Natural and Environmental Sciences at **Newcastle University**, where I am also completing a PhD. My research employs state-of-the-art **atomistic modelling** techniques, both quantum and classical, to investigate the role of defects and dynamics in solid-state systems. My work currently focuses on solid electrolytes, with broader implications for advancing **energy materials** and next-generation energy storage technologies.

Before starting my PhD, I earned a Master's in Chemical Engineering from Lancaster University. My final-year research project, under the supervision of Dr Samuel Murphy, focused on lithium diffusion in solid-state systems for lithium separation, with applications in nuclear materials.
