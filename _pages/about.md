**Frazer Forrester** is a Research Assistant in **Inorganic Chemistry** situation in the School of Natural and Environmental Sciences at **Newcastle University**, where he is also completing his PhD. His research employs state-of-the-art **atomistic modelling** techniques, both quantum and classical, to investigate the role of defects and dynamics in solid-state systems. His work currently focuses on solid electrolytes, with broader implications for advancing **energy materials** and next-generation energy storage technologies.

Prior to starting his PhD, Frazer earned a **Master's degree in Chemical Engineering** from **Lancaster University**. Under the supervision of Dr Samuel Murphy, his final-year research project focused on lithium diffusion in solid-state systems for lithium separation, with applications in nuclear materials.
