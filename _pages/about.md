Hi, I'm **Frazer Forrester** a Research Assistant in **Inorganic Materials** situated in the School of Natural and Environmental Sciences at **Newcastle University**, where I am also completing a PhD. My research employs state-of-the-art **atomistic modelling** techniques, both quantum and classical, to investigate the role of defects and dynamics in solid-state systems. My work currently focuses on solid electrolytes, with broader implications for advancing **energy materials** and next-generation energy storage technologies.

Prior to starting my PhD, I earned a **Master's degree in Chemical Engineering** from **Lancaster University**. Under the supervision of Dr Samuel Murphy, my final-year research project focused on lithium diffusion in solid-state systems for lithium separation, with applications in nuclear materials.
